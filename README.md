# PDF Splitter by Chapter

This Python script splits a large PDF into multiple PDFs by chapter. Each output file is named after the detected chapter (e.g., 'Chapter 1.pdf', 'Chapter 2.pdf', etc.).

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyPDF2

## Installation
Install the required package:

```
pip install PyPDF2
```

## Usage

Place your PDF in the same directory as the script, then run:

```
python split_pdf_by_chapter.py <your_pdf_file.pdf>
```

The script will create separate PDF files for each chapter in the same directory.

## Notes
- Chapters are detected by searching for the word 'Chapter' followed by a number (case-insensitive) on each page.
- If no chapters are found, the script will notify you.
